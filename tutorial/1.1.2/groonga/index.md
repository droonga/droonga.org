## The goal of this tutorial

Learning steps to run a Droonga cluster by your hand, and use it as a [Groonga][groonga] compatible server.

## Precondition

* You must have basic knowledge and experiences to set up and operate an [Ubuntu][] or [CentOS][] Server.
* You must have basic knowledge and experiences to use the [Groonga][groonga] via HTTP.

## What's Droonga?

It is a data processing engine based on a distributed architecture, named after the terms "distributed-Groonga".
As its name suggests, it can work as a Groonga compatible server with some improvements - replication and sharding.

In a certain sense, the Droonga is quite different from Groonga, about its architecture, design, API etc.
However, you don't have to understand the whole architecture of the Droonga, if you simply use it just as a Groonga compatible server.

For example, let's try to build a database system to find [Starbucks stores in New York](http://geocommons.com/overlays/430038).

## Set up a Droonga cluster

A database system based on the Droonga is called *Droonga cluster*.
This section describes how to set up a Droonga cluster from scratch.

### Prepare computers for Droonga nodes

A Droonga cluster is constructed from one or more computers, called *Droonga node*(s).
Prepare computers for Droonga nodes at first.

This tutorial describes steps to set up Droonga cluster based on existing computers.
Following instructions are basically written for a successfully prepared virtual machine of the `Ubuntu 14.04 x64` or `CentOS 7 x64` on the service [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), with an available console.

If you just want to try Droong casually, see another tutorial: [how to prepare multiple virtual machines on your own computer](../virtual-machines-for-experiments/).

NOTE:

 * Make sure to use instances with >= 2GB memory equipped, at least during installation of required packages for Droonga.
   Otherwise, you possibly experience a strange build error.
 * Make sure the hostname reported by `hostname -f` or the IP address reported by `hostname -i` is accessible from each other computer in your cluster.
 * Make sure that commands `curl` and `jq` are installed in your computers.
   `curl` is required to download installation scripts.
   `jq` is not required for installation, but it will help you to read response JSONs returned from Droonga.

You need to prepare two or more nodes for effective replication.
So this tutorial assumes that you have two computers:

 * has an IP address `192.168.100.50`, with a host name `node0`.
 * has an IP address `192.168.100.51`, with a host name `node1`.

### Set up computers as Droonga nodes

Groonga provides binary packages and you can install Groonga easily, for some environments.
(See: [how to install Groonga](http://groonga.org/docs/install.html))

On the other hand, steps to set up a computer as a Droonga node are:

 1. Install the `droonga-engine`.
 2. Install the `droonga-http-server`.
 3. Configure the node to work together with other nodes.

Note that you must do all steps on each computer.
However, they're very simple.

Let's log in to the computer `node0` (`192.168.100.50`), and install Droonga components.

First, install the `droonga-engine`.
It is the core component provides most features of Droonga system.
Download the installation script and run it by `bash` as the root user:

~~~
# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droonga/droonga-engine/master/install.sh | \
    bash
...
Installing droonga-engine from RubyGems...
...
Preparing the user...
...
Setting up the configuration directory...
This node is configured with a hostname XXXXXXXX.

Registering droonga-engine as a service...
...
Successfully installed droonga-engine.
~~~

Note, The name of the node itself (guessed from the host name of the computer) appears in the message.
*It is used in various situations*, so *don't forget what is the name of each node*.

Second, install the `droonga-http-server`.
It is the frontend component required to translate HTTP requests to Droonga's native one.
Download the installation script and run it by `bash` as the root user:

~~~
# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droonga/droonga-http-server/master/install.sh | \
    bash
...
Installing droonga-http-server from npmjs.org...
...
Preparing the user...
...
Setting up the configuration directory...
The droonga-engine service is detected on this node.
The droonga-http-server is configured to be connected
to this node (XXXXXXXX).
This node is configured with a hostname XXXXXXXX.

Registering droonga-http-server as a service...
...
Successfully installed droonga-http-server.
~~~

After that, do same operations on another computer `node1` (`192.168.100.51`) also.
Then two computers successfully prepared to work as Droonga nodes.

### When your computers don't have a host name accessible from other computers... {#accessible-host-name}

Each Droonga node must know the *accessible host name* of the node itself, to communicate with other nodes.

The installation script guesses accessible host name of the node automatically.
You can confirm what value is detected as the host name of the node itself, by following command:

~~~
# cat ~droonga-engine/droonga/droonga-engine.yaml | grep host
host: XXXXXXXX
~~~

However it may be misdetected if the computer is not configured properly.
For example, even if a node is configured with a host name `node0`, it cannot receive any message from other nodes when others cannot resolve the name `node0` to actual IP address.

Then you have to reconfigure your node with raw IP addresse of the node itself, like:

~~~
(on node0=192.168.100.50)
# host=192.168.100.50
# droonga-engine-configure --quiet --reset-config --reset-catalog \
                           --host=$host
# droonga-http-server-configure --quiet --reset-config \
                                --droonga-engine-host-name=$host \
                                --receive-host-name=$host

(on node1=192.168.100.51)
# host=192.168.100.51
...
~~~

Then your computer `node0` is configured as a Droonga node with the host name `192.168.100.50`, and `node1` becomes a node with the name `192.168.100.51`.
As said before, *the configured name is used in various situations*, so *don't forget what is the name of each node*.

This tutorial assumes that all your computers can resolve each other host name `node0` and `node1` correctly.
Otherwise, read host names `node0` and `node1` in following instructions, as raw IP addresses like `192.168.100.50` and `192.168.100.51`.

By the way, you can specify your favorite value as the host name of the computer itself via environment variables, for the installation script, like:

~~~
(on node0=192.168.100.50)
# host=192.168.100.50
# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droonga/droonga-engine/master/install.sh | \
    HOST=$host bash
# curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droonga/droonga-http-server/master/install.sh | \
    ENGINE_HOST=$host HOST=$host bash

(on node1=192.168.100.51)
# host=192.168.100.51
...
~~~

This option will help you, if you already know that your computers are not configured to resolve each other name.

### Configure nodes to work together as a cluster

Currently, these nodes are still individual nodes.
Let's configure them to work together as a cluster.

Run commands like this, on each node:

~~~
# droonga-engine-catalog-generate --hosts=node0,node1
~~~

Of course you must specify correct host name of nodes by the `--hosts` option.
If your nodes are configured with raw IP addresses, the command line is:

~~~
# droonga-engine-catalog-generate --hosts=192.168.100.50,192.168.100.51
~~~

OK, now your Droonga cluster is correctly prepared.
Two nodes are configured to work together as a Droonga cluster.

Let's continue to [the next step, "how to use the cluster"](#use).


## Use the Droonga cluster, via HTTP (and its native protocol) {#use}

There are two different interfaces to communicate with a Droonga cluster: HTTP and Droonga's native protocol (same to fluentd's one).

 * HTTP interface is useful for Web applications.
   If your application is based on Groonga with its HTTP interface, it can migrate to Droonga easily.
 * The native protocol has better performance, but difficult to use a little.
   However, there are a client library and command line utilities supporting it.

This section's instructions are mainly based on HTTP.

### Start and stop services on each Droonga node

You can run Groonga as an HTTP server daemon with the option `-d`, like:

~~~
# groonga -p 10041 -d --protocol http /tmp/databases/db
~~~

On the other hand, you have to run multiple server daemons for each Droonga node to use your Droonga cluster via HTTP.

If you set up your Droonga nodes by installation scripts, daemons are already been configured as system services managed via the `service` command.
To start them, run commands like following on each Droonga node:

~~~
# service droonga-engine start
# service droonga-http-server start
~~~

By these commands, services start to work.
Now two nodes construct a cluster and they monitor each other.
If one of nodes dies and there is any still alive node, survivor(s) will work as the Droonga cluster.
Then you can recover the dead node and re-join it to the cluster secretly.

Important note: both `droonga-engine` and `droonga-http-server` resolve dependencies automatically on the startup.
For example, they download [Serf](https://www.serfdom.io/)'s binary.
After all dependencies are resolved, they start working.
So, you may have to wait for a while, on the initial startup.

Let's make sure that the cluster works, by a Droonga command, `system.status`.
You can see the result via HTTP, like:

~~~
$ curl "http://node0:10041/droonga/system/status" | jq "."
{
  "nodes": {
    "node0:10031/droonga": {
      "status": "active"
    },
    "node1:10031/droonga": {
      "status": "active"
    }
  },
  "reporter": "..."
}
~~~

The result says that two nodes are working correctly.
Because it is a cluster, another endpoint returns same result.

~~~
$ curl "http://node1:10041/droonga/system/status" | jq "."
{
  "nodes": {
    "node0:10031/droonga": {
      "status": "active"
    },
    "node1:10031/droonga": {
      "status": "active"
    }
  },
  "reporter": "..."
}
~~~

`droonga-http-server` connects to all `droonga-engine` in the cluster, and distributes requests to them like a load balancer.
Moreover, even if some `droonga-engine`s stop, `droonga-http-server` wards off those dead engines automatically, and the cluster keeps itself correctly working.

To stop services, run commands like following on each Droonga node:

~~~
# service droonga-engine stop
# service droonga-http-server stop
~~~

After verification, start services again, on each Droonga node.


### Communicating with Droonga cluster via its native protocol

On the other hand, you can send any native message to `droonga-engine` servers by the command line utility `droonca-request`, included in the gem package `droonga-client`.
For example, you can send a `system.status` request to a `droonga-engine` node bypassing `droonga-http-server` service, like:

~~~
$ echo '{"dataset":"Default","type":"system.status"}' | \
    droonga-request --host node0 --receiver-host node0
Elapsed time: 0.023726995
{
  "inReplyTo": "1430292510.4677904",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "type": "system.status.result",
  "body": {
    "nodes": {
      "node0:10031/droonga": {
        "status": "active"
      },
      "node1:10031/droonga": {
        "status": "active"
      }
    },
    "reporter": "..."
  }
}
~~~

As above, Droonga's native message is written in the JSON format.
Because it is very different from Groonga's method, this tutorial doesn't describe details of this way, for now.


### Create a table, columns, and indexes

Now your Droonga cluster actually works as an HTTP server compatible to Groonga's HTTP server.

Requests are completely same to ones for a Groonga server.
To create a new table `Store`, you just have to send a GET request for the `table_create` command, like:

~~~
$ endpoint="http://node0:10041"
$ curl "$endpoint/d/table_create?name=Store&flags=TABLE_PAT_KEY&key_type=ShortText" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1401358896.360356,
    0.0035653114318847656
  ],
  true
]
~~~

Note that you have to specify the host, one of Droonga nodes with active droonga-http-server, in your Droonga cluster.
In other words, you can use any favorite node in the cluster as an endpoint.
All requests will be distributed to suitable nodes in the cluster.

OK, now the table has been created successfully.
Let's see it by the `table_list` command:

~~~
$ curl "$endpoint/d/table_list" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1401358908.9126804,
    0.001600027084350586
  ],
  [
    [
      [
        "id",
        "UInt32"
      ],
      [
        "name",
        "ShortText"
      ],
      [
        "path",
        "ShortText"
      ],
      [
        "flags",
        "ShortText"
      ],
      [
        "domain",
        "ShortText"
      ],
      [
        "range",
        "ShortText"
      ],
      [
        "default_tokenizer",
        "ShortText"
      ],
      [
        "normalizer",
        "ShortText"
      ]
    ],
    [
      256,
      "Store",
      "/home/vagrant/droonga/000/db.0000100",
      "TABLE_PAT_KEY|PERSISTENT",
      "ShortText",
      null,
      null,
      null
    ]
  ]
]
~~~

Because it is a cluster, another endpoint returns same result.

~~~
$ curl "http://node1:10041/d/table_list" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1401358908.9126804,
    0.001600027084350586
  ],
  [
    [
      [
        "id",
        "UInt32"
      ],
      [
        "name",
        "ShortText"
      ],
      [
        "path",
        "ShortText"
      ],
      [
        "flags",
        "ShortText"
      ],
      [
        "domain",
        "ShortText"
      ],
      [
        "range",
        "ShortText"
      ],
      [
        "default_tokenizer",
        "ShortText"
      ],
      [
        "normalizer",
        "ShortText"
      ]
    ],
    [
      256,
      "Store",
      "/home/vagrant/droonga/000/db.0000100",
      "TABLE_PAT_KEY|PERSISTENT",
      "ShortText",
      null,
      null,
      null
    ]
  ]
]
~~~

Next, create new columns `name` and `location` to the `Store` table by the `column_create` command, like:

~~~
$ curl "$endpoint/d/column_create?table=Store&name=name&flags=COLUMN_SCALAR&type=ShortText" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1401358348.6541538,
    0.0004096031188964844
  ],
  true
]
$ curl "$endpoint/d/column_create?table=Store&name=location&flags=COLUMN_SCALAR&type=WGS84GeoPoint" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1401358359.084659,
    0.002511262893676758
  ],
  true
]
~~~

Create indexes also.

~~~
$ curl "$endpoint/d/table_create?name=Term&flags=TABLE_PAT_KEY&key_type=ShortText&default_tokenizer=TokenBigram&normalizer=NormalizerAuto" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1401358475.7229664,
    0.002419710159301758
  ],
  true
]
$ curl "$endpoint/d/column_create?table=Term&name=store_name&flags=COLUMN_INDEX|WITH_POSITION&type=Store&source=name" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1401358494.1656318,
    0.006799221038818359
  ],
  true
]
$ curl "$endpoint/d/table_create?name=Location&flags=TABLE_PAT_KEY&key_type=WGS84GeoPoint" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1401358505.708896,
    0.0016951560974121094
  ],
  true
]
$ curl "$endpoint/d/column_create?table=Location&name=store&flags=COLUMN_INDEX&type=Store&source=location" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1401358519.6187897,
    0.024788379669189453
  ],
  true
]
~~~

Let's confirm results:

### Load data to a table

Let's load data to the `Store` table.
First, prepare the data as a JSON file `stores.json`.

stores.json:

~~~
[
["_key","name","location"],
["store0","1st Avenue & 75th St. - New York NY  (W)","40.770262,-73.954798"],
["store1","76th & Second - New York NY  (W)","40.771056,-73.956757"],
["store2","2nd Ave. & 9th Street - New York NY","40.729445,-73.987471"],
["store3","15th & Third - New York NY  (W)","40.733946,-73.9867"],
["store4","41st and Broadway - New York NY  (W)","40.755111,-73.986225"],
["store5","84th & Third Ave - New York NY  (W)","40.777485,-73.954979"],
["store6","150 E. 42nd Street - New York NY  (W)","40.750784,-73.975582"],
["store7","West 43rd and Broadway - New York NY  (W)","40.756197,-73.985624"],
["store8","Macy's 35th Street Balcony - New York NY","40.750703,-73.989787"],
["store9","Macy's 6th Floor - Herald Square - New York NY  (W)","40.750703,-73.989787"],
["store10","Herald Square- Macy's - New York NY","40.750703,-73.989787"],
["store11","Macy's 5th Floor - Herald Square - New York NY  (W)","40.750703,-73.989787"],
["store12","80th & York - New York NY  (W)","40.772204,-73.949862"],
["store13","Columbus @ 67th - New York NY  (W)","40.774009,-73.981472"],
["store14","45th & Broadway - New York NY  (W)","40.75766,-73.985719"],
["store15","Marriott Marquis - Lobby - New York NY","40.759123,-73.984927"],
["store16","Second @ 81st - New York NY  (W)","40.77466,-73.954447"],
["store17","52nd & Seventh - New York NY  (W)","40.761829,-73.981141"],
["store18","1585 Broadway (47th) - New York NY  (W)","40.759806,-73.985066"],
["store19","85th & First - New York NY  (W)","40.776101,-73.949971"],
["store20","92nd & 3rd - New York NY  (W)","40.782606,-73.951235"],
["store21","165 Broadway - 1 Liberty - New York NY  (W)","40.709727,-74.011395"],
["store22","1656 Broadway - New York NY  (W)","40.762434,-73.983364"],
["store23","54th & Broadway - New York NY  (W)","40.764275,-73.982361"],
["store24","Limited Brands-NYC - New York NY","40.765219,-73.982025"],
["store25","19th & 8th - New York NY  (W)","40.743218,-74.000605"],
["store26","60th & Broadway-II - New York NY  (W)","40.769196,-73.982576"],
["store27","63rd & Broadway - New York NY  (W)","40.771376,-73.982709"],
["store28","195 Broadway - New York NY  (W)","40.710703,-74.009485"],
["store29","2 Broadway - New York NY  (W)","40.704538,-74.01324"],
["store30","2 Columbus Ave. - New York NY  (W)","40.769262,-73.984764"],
["store31","NY Plaza - New York NY  (W)","40.702802,-74.012784"],
["store32","36th and Madison - New York NY  (W)","40.748917,-73.982683"],
["store33","125th St. btwn Adam Clayton & FDB - New York NY","40.808952,-73.948229"],
["store34","70th & Broadway - New York NY  (W)","40.777463,-73.982237"],
["store35","2138 Broadway - New York NY  (W)","40.781078,-73.981167"],
["store36","118th & Frederick Douglas Blvd. - New York NY  (W)","40.806176,-73.954109"],
["store37","42nd & Second - New York NY  (W)","40.750069,-73.973393"],
["store38","Broadway @ 81st - New York NY  (W)","40.784972,-73.978987"],
["store39","Fashion Inst of Technology - New York NY","40.746948,-73.994557"]
]
~~~

Then, send it as a POST request of the `load` command, like:

~~~
$ curl --data "@stores.json" "$endpoint/d/load?table=Store" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1401358564.909,
    0.158
  ],
  [
    40
  ]
]
~~~

Now all data in the JSON file are successfully loaded.

### Select data from a table

OK, all data is now ready.

As the starter, let's select initial ten records with the `select` command:

~~~
$ curl "$endpoint/d/select?table=Store&output_columns=name&limit=10" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1401362059.7437818,
    4.935264587402344e-05
  ],
  [
    [
      [
        40
      ],
      [
        [
          "name",
          "ShortText"
        ]
      ],
      [
        "1st Avenue & 75th St. - New York NY  (W)"
      ],
      [
        "76th & Second - New York NY  (W)"
      ],
      [
        "Herald Square- Macy's - New York NY"
      ],
      [
        "Macy's 5th Floor - Herald Square - New York NY  (W)"
      ],
      [
        "80th & York - New York NY  (W)"
      ],
      [
        "Columbus @ 67th - New York NY  (W)"
      ],
      [
        "45th & Broadway - New York NY  (W)"
      ],
      [
        "Marriott Marquis - Lobby - New York NY"
      ],
      [
        "Second @ 81st - New York NY  (W)"
      ],
      [
        "52nd & Seventh - New York NY  (W)"
      ]
    ]
  ]
]
~~~

Of course you can specify conditions via the `query` option:

~~~
$ curl "$endpoint/d/select?table=Store&query=Columbus&match_columns=name&output_columns=name&limit=10" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1398670157.661574,
    0.0012705326080322266
  ],
  [
    [
      [
        2
      ],
      [
        [
          "_key",
          "ShortText"
        ]
      ],
      [
        "Columbus @ 67th - New York NY  (W)"
      ],
      [
        "2 Columbus Ave. - New York NY  (W)"
      ]
    ]
  ]
]
$ curl "$endpoint/d/select?table=Store&filter=name@'Ave'&output_columns=name&limit=10" | jq "."
[
  [
    0,
    1398670586.193325,
    0.0003848075866699219
  ],
  [
    [
      [
        3
      ],
      [
        [
          "_key",
          "ShortText"
        ]
      ],
      [
        "2nd Ave. & 9th Street - New York NY"
      ],
      [
        "84th & Third Ave - New York NY  (W)"
      ],
      [
        "2 Columbus Ave. - New York NY  (W)"
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you did set up a [Droonga][] cluster on [Ubuntu Linux][Ubuntu] or [CentOS][] computers.
Moreover, you load data to it and select data from it successfully, as a [Groonga][] compatible server.

Currently, Droonga supports only some limited features of Groonga compatible commands.
See the [command reference][] for more details.

Next, let's learn [how to backup and restore contents of a Droonga cluster](../dump-restore/).

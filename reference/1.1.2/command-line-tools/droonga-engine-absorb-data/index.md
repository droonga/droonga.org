## Abstract {#abstract}

`droonga-engine-absorb-data` copies all data of the specified source dataset to the destination dataset.

For example, if there is a Droonga Engine node `192.168.100.50` which is a node in the source cluster and you are logged in to a computer `192.168.200.10` which is another Droonga Engine node in the destination cluster, the command line to copy all data from `192.168.100.50` to `192.168.200.10` is:

~~~
(on 192.168.200.10)
$ droonga-engine-absorb-data --host 192.168.200.10 \
                             --receiver-host 192.168.200.10 \
                             --source-host 192.168.100.50
Start to absorb data from Default at 192.168.100.50:10031/droonga
                       to Default at 192.168.200.10:10031/droonga
                      via 192.168.200.10 (this host)

The timestamp of the last processed message in the source node: 2015-04-29T10:07:08.230158Z
Setting the destination node to ignore messages older than the timestamp...

Done.

This command can copy all data from a dataset to another dataset in a Droonga cluster.
For example, this is a command line to copy existing master dataset to another dataset for testing:

~~~
(on 192.168.100.50)
$ droonga-engine-absorb-data --receiver-host 192.168.100.50 \
                             --host 192.168.100.50 \
                             --dataset Testing \
                             --source-host 192.168.100.50 \
                             --source-dataset Default
Start to absorb data from Default at 192.168.100.50:10031/droonga
                       to Testing at 192.168.100.50:10031/droonga
                      via 192.168.100.50 (this host)

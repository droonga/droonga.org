## Abstract {#abstract}

`droonga-add` adds a new record or updates an existing record, to the specified table in a Droonga cluster.

For example, if there is a Droonga Engine node `192.168.100.50` and you are logged in to a computer `192.168.100.10` in the same network segment, the command line to add a new record to the table `User` in the cluster is:

~~~
(on 192.168.100.10)
$ droonga-add --host 192.168.100.50 --receiver-host 192.168.100.10 \
    --table User --key id1 --name Adam --age 20
Adding new record...
{
  "table": "Store",
  "key": "id1",
  "values": {
    "name": "Adam",
    "age": "20"
  }
}
Done.
~~~

This command is just a shorthand of [`droonga-request`](../droonga-request/) with a message with the type [`add`](../../commands/add/).
The result produced by the following command line almost equals to the one of above:

~~~
(on 192.168.100.10)
$ echo '{"type":"add","body":{"key":"id1","values":{"name":"Adam","age":20}}}' |
    droonga-request --report-request --host 192.168.100.50 --receiver-host 192.168.100.10
Request: {
  "type": "add",
  "body": {
    "table": "Store",
    "key": "id1",
    "values": {
      "name": "Adam",
      "age": "20"
    }
  },
  "id": "1430961788.4171028",
  "date": "2015-05-07T02:39:50.334377Z",
  "dataset": "Default"
}

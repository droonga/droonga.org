## Abstract {#abstract}

`droonga-engine-configure` configures the computer itself as a `droonga-engine` node.

The most major usecase of this command is to reset a computer as a clean, blank Droonga Engine node for [the `droonga-engine-join` command](../droonga-engine-join/).

This command asks you interactively how to configure the computer, like:

~~~
# droonga-engine-configure
The droonga-engine service is now running.
Before reconfiguration, the service is going to be stopped and this node will be unjoined from the cluster.
Are you sure you want to continue reconfiguration? (y/N): y
Do you want all data to be cleared? (y/N): y
Do you want the configuration file "droonga-engine.yaml" to be regenerated? (y/N): y
Do you want the file "catalog.json" to be regenerated? (y/N): y
host [192.168.100.50]: 
port [10031]: 
tag [droonga]: 
log level (trace,debug,info,warn,error,fatal) [warn]: 
~~~

This command can work silently with command line options when you have complete plan, like:

~~~
# droonga-engine-configure \
    --no-prompt \
    --clear \
    --reset-config \
    --reset-catalog \
    --host nodeX \
    --port 20032 \
    --tag droonga \
    --log-level info
~~~

If the `droonga-engine` service is correctly registered as a service, this command works only to configure the installed service and some options (not used for the service) are ignored.


## Parameters {#parameters}

`--no-prompt`
: Never show any interactive prompt.
  If this options is given, all configurations not specified by following options are filled by their default value.
  Otherwise prompts are shown for options.

`--clear`
: Clears all existing data in the data directory of the `droonga-engine` service.

`--reset-config`
: Replaces existing `droonga-engine.yaml` with the new one.
  If this option is given, `droonga-engine.yaml` is overwritten without confirmation.
  Otherwise a confirmation prompt is shown, if there is existing `droonga-engine.yaml`.

`--reset-catalog`
: Replaces existing `catalog.json` with new clean one including only an orphan Engine node.
  If this option is given, `catalog.json` is overwritten without confirmation.
  Otherwise a confirmation prompt is shown, if there is existing `catalog.json`.

`--host=HOST`
: Host name of the engine node itself.
  A guessed host name of the computer you are running the command, by default.

`--port=PORT`
: Port number to wait connection from clients and other nodes.
  `10031` by default.

`--tag=TAG`
: Tag name to accept incoming messages with.
  `droonga` by default.

`--internal-connection-lifetime=SECONDS`
: The time to expire internal connections, in seconds.
  `60` by default.

`--log-level=LEVEL`
: Log level for the logger.
  Possible values are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` and `fatal`.
  `warn` by default.

`--log-file=PATH`
: Path to the file all log messages are printed into.
  If this option is not specified, logs are printed to the standard output.

`--daemon`, `--no-daemon`
: Run as a daemon or a regular process.
  However, the `droonga-engine` service always started as a daemon by the command line `service droonga-engine start`, even if these options are given.

`--pid-file=PATH`
: Path to put the process ID of the daemon process.
  However, the process ID of the `droonga-engine` service always stored at the platform specific location by the command line `service droonga-engine start`, even if this option is given.

`--base-dir=PATH`
: Path to the directory all `droonga-engine` related files are stored into.
  However, the location `/home/droonga-engine/droonga/` is always used for the `droonga-engine` service started by the command line `service droonga-engine start`, even if this option is given.

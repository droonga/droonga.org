## Abstract {#abstract}

`droonga-engine-join` puts an orphan Droonga Engine node in an existing Droonga cluster as a new replica node.

For example, if there is an existing Droonga Engine node `192.168.100.50` which is a replica node in a cluster and you are logged in to a computer `192.168.100.10` which is already prepared orphan Engine node in the same network segment, the command line to put the joining node `192.168.100.10` in the cluster as a new replica node is:

~~~
(on 192.168.100.10)
$ droonga-engine-join --host 192.168.100.10 \
                      --receiver-host 192.168.100.10 \
                      --replica-source-host 192.168.100.50
Start to join a new node 192.168.100.10
       to the cluster of 192.168.100.50
                     via 192.168.100.10 (this host)
    port    = 10031
    tag     = droonga
    dataset = Default

## Parameters {#parameters}

`--no-copy`
: Don't copy data from the source node.
  If you specify this option, the node joins as a replica without synchronizing of data.

`--host=NAME`
: Host name of the new node to be joined.
  This is a required parameter.

`--replica-source-host=NAME`
: Host name of the soruce node in the cluster to join.
  This is a required parameter.

`--port=PORT`
: Port number to communicate with engine nodes.
  `10031` by default.

`--tag=TAG`
: Tag name to communicate with engine nodes.
  `droonga` by default.

`--dataset=NAME`
: Dataset name the node is going to join as a replica in.
  `Default` by default.

`--receiver-host=NAME`
: Host name of the computer you are running this command.
  A guessed host name of the computer, by default.

`--records-per-second=N`
: Maximum number of records to be copied per one second.
  `-1` means "no limit".
  `100` by default.

`--progress-interval-seconds=SECONDS`
: Interval seconds to report progress of data copying.
  `3` by default.

`--verbose`
: Output details for internal operations.
  This is mainly for debugging.

`-h`, `--help`
: Shows the usage of the command.

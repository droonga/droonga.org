## Abstract {#abstract}

`droonga-system-status` reports current status of a Droonga cluster.

For example, if there is a Droonga Engine node `192.168.100.50` and you are logged in to a computer `192.168.100.10` in the same network segment, the command line to report status of the cluster is:

~~~
(on 192.168.100.10)
$ droonga-system-status --host 192.168.100.50 --receiver-host 192.168.100.10 --pretty
{
  "nodes": {
    "node0:10031/droonga": {
      "status": "active"
    },
    "node1:10031/droonga": {
      "status": "active"
    }
  },
  "reporter": "node0:55329/droonga @ node0:10031/droonga"
}
~~~

This command is just a shorthand of [`droonga-request`](../droonga-request/) with a message with the type [`system.status`](../../commands/system/status/).
The result produced by the following command line almost equals to the one of above:

~~~
(on 192.168.100.10)
$ echo '{"type":"system.status"}' |
    droonga-request --report-request --host 192.168.100.50 --receiver-host 192.168.100.10

      }
    },
    "reporter": "node0:55329/droonga @ node0:10031/droonga"
  }
}
